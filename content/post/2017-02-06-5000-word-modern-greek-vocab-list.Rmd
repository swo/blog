title: 5,000 word modern Greek vocab list
---

I'm studying modern Greek, and I've had trouble finding good resources for vocabulary. Most vocab lists I find are for ancient or New Testament Greek.

I did find [this list](http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/language/ModernGreekFlashCards.pdf) of 5,000 words (which appears to be linked to [this page](http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/)Â at York University, but I can't otherwise find a way to credit the creator of this list). It's a pdf, so I parsed it into [tab-separated format](https://github.com/swo/modern-greek-flashcards/blob/master/vocab.tsv) (using `pdftotext` and [Python](https://github.com/swo/modern-greek-flashcards)). Enjoy!
