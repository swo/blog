_One day in Athens, the microbiome scientist Everymeno encounters 16Socrates._

_Everymeno_: Hail, 16Socrates! I've been troubled by some results from my 16S amplicon sequencing data, and I was hoping to hear your wisdom.

_16Socrates_: I don't know that I can answer your questions, but we can look for an answer together.

_E_: In a microbiome experiment, I collected samples, extracted the DNA, and amplified the 16S gene. I'm converting the raw 16S sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). I know there's a lot of [discussion](https://figshare.com/articles/2015_Poster_on_OTU_robustness_reproducibility_amp_ecological_consistency/1437744) in the Microbiome [Agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora) about what kinds of OTU-calling methods we should use, so I tried to avoid controversy by using all of them and seeing what comes out...
