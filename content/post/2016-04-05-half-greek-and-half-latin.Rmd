title: Half Greek and half Latin

In college I was stage manager for a [production](http://capandbells.org/) of Tom Stoppard's [_The Invention of Love_](http://www.amazon.com/Invention-Love-Tom-Stoppard/dp/0802135811), a long play (I think ours was about 5 hours) about memory, scholarship, classics, love, _et al. _set in 19th century Oxford. In one of my favorite moments, the main character, a homosexual, hears the word "homosexual" for the first time. He responds, " '_Homo_sexuals'? Who is responsible for this barbarity? [...] It's half Greek and half Latin!" He's upset that "homosexual" is a [mashup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_word) of the Ancient Greek ομός (meaning "like" or "same") and the Latin _sexualis_ ("relating to sex").

I had my own "who is responsible for this barbarity" moment yesterday when I learned about the etymology of the words "polygamy" and "polygyny". I had just told a friend that "polyamory" is one of these Greek-Latin hybrids (Greek πολύ ["much"] + Latin _amor_ love). I was then struck by the weirdness of these other word's etymologies:

"Polygamy" means (according to the dictionary) having sex with multiple partners regardless of marriage status. This is odd, since the root is Greek-Greek πολύ "many" + γάμος "marriage". Contrast this against "polygyny", which the dictionary says means a marriage practice in which one man has many wives. The root here is πολύ + Ancient Greek γυνή "woman, wife". I've always heard people say that, for example, the Mormon church used to practice poly_gamy_, but by this definition it should be said that they used to practice poly_gyny_. The Ancient Greeks made _y_ and _a_ sound really different, but in English we pronounce both of them mostly like _uh_, so I have a hard time hearing whether someone said poly_gam_y or poly_gyn_y.

What a mess.
