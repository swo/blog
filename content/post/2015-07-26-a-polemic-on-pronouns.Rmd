English speakers used to distinguish between _thou_, a word used to address a single person, and _you_, a word used to address more than one person. Just as kings used a royal, plural _we_ when referring to one person, English speakers came to use a flattering _you_ when addressing a single person. The Quakers retained _thou_ to avoid elevating anyone with _you_. To non-Quakers, this standing on principle sounded antiquated and pedantic.





Today we face a similar problem that mixes plurality and sociology: we are told that the singular, third person pronoun is _he_. We are told that _she_ implies a gender; while to say _he_ could mean either male or genderless. This is confusing, so in speech we use a singular _they_. (“Some_one_ came up to me and _they_ said...”) We are told that, in writing, it is incorrect to use the singular _they_ because they "should be" plural. Instead we are told to use _he_, which "should be" (or, preposterously, "is") genderless.





_He_ and _she_ are gendered now and have always been gendered. When _he_ was first used, it was believed that men were genderless: men were people and women—the _she_—were something different. The _he_-is-genderless rule was not a product of rational grammatical thought; it was the result of a long history of misogyny. Today I hear some wishy-washy in-between to justify this rule: women are people, but we only have _he_ and _she_ to pick from, and he has historically been used to refer a person, so let us stick with _he_. This is a mistake.





I say, let us call a single person _they_, keeping _he_ for men and _she_ for women. Let us do in our writing as we do in our speech. Maybe this is bad for grammar, but it is good for women, and I would rather grammar suffer than women.
