title: Questions you can ask your doctor
---

I just finished Jerome Groopman's [_How Doctors Think_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Doctors_Think). In general, I think the topic of medical thinking is fascinating. I was a little disappointed by the book, which is long on colorful anecdotes and personal experiences but short on research and policy. I'm difficult to please.

One frustration I had with the book is that Groopman had sprinkled paragraphs throughout the book that say something like, "To avoid a medical thinking mishap like the one this anecdote illustrated, you might consider asking your doctor _X_." Because there was no appendix collecting these questions, I've put those questions and their motivations here.



##### Before a diagnosis







  * I'm really worried that these symptoms mean _X_. Is that possible? [_The idea here is to get you to say the thing that's really worrying you, even if you fear that naming it will make it real._]


  * What is the worse thing this could be? Is there a possibility that these symptoms are related to something that could kill or seriously injure me? [_The idea here is to encourage the doctor to think outside the box of normal, routine illnesses._]


  * What body parts are near where I am having this symptom? [_The idea here is to encourage the doctor to enumerate other possibilities for where the symptom is coming from. The gut is near the ovaries, and a bad stomach ache might actually be an ectopic pregnancy._]





##### After a diagnosis







  * What else could this be? [_It's tempting to stop searching for things once you've found one thing. This encourages the doctor to think that maybe there is something more that she should look for._]


  * What if I have more than one problem? [_Again, it's tempting to diagnose a single condition. One condition might hide another__._]


  * Which of my signs and symptoms don't fit this diagnosis? [_Asking for contradictory evidence can fight confirmation bias._]


  * Let me tell you my whole story again. Try to forget what you heard the first time and the diagnosis you made. [_This is hard to do for the same doctor, but it might help if you go to another doctor. It's easy for a doctor to read another doctor's diagnosis, accept it as fact, and not think on their own about the raw data of your experiences._]





##### Before assenting to a test, scan, or procedure







  * What's the probability that something will be found? [_This fights a kitchen sink or "let's see what we see" kind of thinking._]


  * What can this test uncover that will confirm or change my diagnosis? [_It's tempting to just order a test without having a clear sense of whether that test is actually the right thing to do for that diagnosis._]


  * How often does this test give wrong results? [_To not allow the doctor to unload the cognitive burden of figuring out what is wrong_.]


  * When can the data from this test give the wrong impression? [_To encourage other ways of thinking or testing that can be correlated against an imperfect test._]


  * What are possible complications?


  * If there will be pain or discomfort, what other experience I've had has had a comparable amount of pain? A mosquito bite? A migraine? A bone being set?
