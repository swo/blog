# Gin rummy

2 players.

**Setup**. Deal 10 cards to both players. The next card, faceup, starts the
*discard pile*. The rest of the deck, facedown, is the *stock pile*.

**Starting the first turn**. The non-dealer can take the single discarded card
or pass. If they pass, the dealer can take the discarded card. If they also
pass, the non-dealer must draw from the stock pile. Play continues as normal.

**The rest of the turns**. (1) You must draw the top card of the stock pile or
the discard pile. (2) You must discard a card. (3) If you have 10 or fewer
*deadwood* points, you can *knock* (end the round).

**Melds and deadwood.** Cards in your hand that are not in *melds* are
deadwood. Each card can be in only one meld. The possible melds are sets (3-4
cards of the same rank, e.g., three Jacks) and runs (3+ sequential cards of the
same suit; e.g., 3◊ 4◊ 5◊). Ace is low (Ace-2-3 is a run but *not* Queen-King-Ace).

**Counting deadwood**. Ace = 1 point, 2 = 2 points, 3 = 3 points, &c. Face
cards are each 10 points.

**Ending the round**. Both players lay out their hands. The defender can *lay
off* deadwood by adding it to the knocker's melds. The knocker's score is
defender's deadwood points minus knocker's deadwood points.

**Going gin**. If the knocker has no deadwood, the defender cannot lay off
deadwood, and the knocker gets a 25 point bonus.

**Undercutting**. If the defender has fewer deadwood points than the knocker,
the defender scores knocker's deadwood minus defender's deadwood plus bonus 25.

**Scoring**. In a single-match game, play until 100 points. For a multi-match
game, keep a game score and a match score. At the end of a 100-point match, the
match winner's game score goes up by the match score, a 100 point "game bonus",
and 25 points per deal won ("box bonus").

# Oh hell

2-4 players; 4 is best.

**The deal**. In the 1st round, each player is dealt 1 card. In the 2nd, 2
cards, etc. until there are not enough cards in the deck to increase hand size.
At that point, hand size decreases per round back down to 1. The next card from
the deck is turned face up to determine trump.

**Bidding**. Starting with the player left of the dealer, each player makes a
bid for the number of tricks they will take.

**The play**. The player who bid first leads the first trick. Any card can be
lead. Each player must follow suit if able. The highest trump wins; if there
are no trumps, then the highest card of the suit led wins. The winner of the
trick leads the next trick.

**Scoring**. Each player wins 1 point for each trick and 10 bonus points if
they exactly made their bid.

**Variants**. *Screw the dealer*: All player's bids must sum to the number of
tricks. *Up and down*: If you exactly make your bid, you win that number of
points. If you go over, you lose one point per trick over the bid. If you go
under, you lose 2 points per trick under the bid. *Hoyle*: Win the bid plus 10
if you exactly make the bid; zero otherwise. The last hand has no trump.

# Durak / Дурак

For 2-8 players. 4 is best.

**Setup**. For 2-4 players, remove cards 5 and below to make a pack of 36. For
5-8 players, use the whole deck. Deal 6 cards to each player. The next card,
turned face-up, indicated the trump suit. Put the draw pile on top of that
card. On the first hand, the player with the lowest trump leads.

**Starting the attack**. The active player is the *attacker.* The player to
their left is the *defender.* The attacker leads the attack by playing one card
from their hand, face-up, to the defender. The defender can *cover* an
attacking card with a card of the same suit and higher rank. Trumps of any rank
beat trumps of any other suit, but a trump can only be covered by a higher
trump.

**Continuing the attack**. The attacker and all other players who are not the
defender can attack the defender with cards whose rank is equal to a card
already played in attack or defense. Only 6 cards (or the number of cards in
the defender's hand, whichever is lower) can be played in attack.

**Ending the attack**. If the defending player can cover all attacking cards,
all attacking and covering cards are placed into a discard pile and the
defender becomes the next attacker. If the defender cannot or chooses not to
cover all attacking cards, they must pick up all attacking and covering cards
into their hand. Their attack is skipped, and the player to their left is the
next attacker.

**Drawing new cards**. After the attack is complete, starting with the original
attacking player and going clockwise, each player draws cards from the stock to
replenish their hand to 6 cards. Players with 6 or more cards do not draw new
cards.

**Ending the game**. The face-up trump at the bottom of the draw pile is drawn
last. After that, play continues, but no new cards are drawn. The last player
with cards in their head is called the fool (дурак) and loses. In the next
game, the player to the left of the loser attacks first.

**Passing (переводной)**. If a defender has not covered any attacking cards,
they may play one or more cards of the same rank as the attacking card(s) and
pass those cards to the player to their left, who is now the defender.
